TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds optional static types, interfaces, classes, and other features to JavaScript that are checked at compile time by the TypeScript compiler. TypeScript code is converted to JavaScript code, which means it is converted into pure JavaScript that the browser can understand. This transpilation step ensures that TypeScript code can run on any JavaScript runtime environment, allowing developers to write safer, more maintainable code while still leveraging the ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks.


TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, interfaces, and other features to enhance code reliability and maintainability. It compiles to standard JavaScript, allowing TypeScript code to be executed in any JavaScript environment, including browsers, Node.js, and more. TypeScript improves developer productivity by catching type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime, providing better code tooling with IntelliSense, refactoring tools, and documentation generation. Developers can gradually adopt TypeScript by adding type annotations and type-checking while still writing regular JavaScript code, enabling a flexible transition to a more robust coding approach. Despite its compile-time type checks, TypeScript remains interoperable with existing JavaScript code, making it a powerful tool for building scalable and reliable applications.
