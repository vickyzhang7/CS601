Explanation of corrections:

8ball variable name was corrected to eightBall.
The if statement syntax was incorrect. It seems you want to use a for loop instead.
The : should be replaced with ; in the for loop syntax.
The document.alert was corrected to alert.
The string interpolation syntax was incorrect. It should be done using backticks () instead of double quotes ("`).
It's unclear what j is in your code. Make sure to define it before using it in the loop condition.
